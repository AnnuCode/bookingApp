# Booking app created with React Hooks
This bookings app is created using React Hooks and React Router, seving as a single page application.   

## Setup
The app was created with create-react-app:

    npx create-react-app react-hooks-in-action

React Router and React Icons were then installed:

    npm i react-router@next react-router-dom@next
    npm i react-icons
    

## Pages
The app includes three pages:
* Bookings
* Bookables
* Users

React Router (v6) is used to link to and render the three pages.

## Components
There is a component for each page. There is also a UserPicker component that is currently just a drop-down list with one item: Users.
